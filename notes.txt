########        Execution + how it works          ########

The script checks if its the main program being executed, starts cmdloop which listens for commands and dispatches to the appropriate do_command method

When u run the script, it presents a prompt hbnb where u can type commands
typing a command and pressing enter invokes the corresponding command method in the HBNBCommand class.
Each method performs its function like creating or showing model instances, and provides feedback based on the action success or failure.
The interpreter uses an instance of FileStorage to persist data across sessions, indicated by calls to 'save' and mainpulations of storage.all().
